                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p> Hi, my name is Brandon javillo and here is a little about me. I am a recently retired US Army
                        Veteran,
                        proud to have served and love every minute of the traveling and relationships I've built along
                        the way!
                        Currently I am married to the most beautiful, loving, caring, and amazing woman and I have 4
                        children. I
                        spent 20 years in the military as an aircraft electrician and loved my job! I left the Army
                        earlier than
                        I really wanted to, but moved on to a bigger and better future with coding. I recently just
                        started in
                        the UC Davis Full Stack bootcamp and when complete, plan to move on to UNLV to complete a BS in
                        Computer
                        Science. Let's just say because of my love for videogames and my job in the militray, I now have
                        chosen
                        something that I enjoy and look forward to learning anything and everything I can! </p>

                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                    <p> I am a pretty simple person who doesn't like to be bothered with the stressful things in life.
                        I've spent a lot of time worrying about pleasing others just to try and get ahead in life, which
                        caused many headaches and confrontations. Now I only look forward to reaching one goal in life,
                        which is the pursuit of happiness! For me and my family, enjoying life and what it has to offer
                        is everything that you need to be happy!</p>
